TO DO LIST

1. [ ] Change broadphase box dimensions to adjust with the scene, instead of being arbitrarily set
2. [x] Make narrowphase avoid duplicate collision checks on two objects spanning two octants
	2.a [x] Change octree so that a node stradling a boundary is in the parent node's list.	
		2.a.i [x] Make sure each node is only stored once now, not in multiple lists
3. [ ] Put Octree functionality into its own class
4. [ ] Change octree when a node moves zone
	4.a [ ] Fix this, the octree breaks when a node moves - possibly not terminating the tree correctly.
5. [x] Octree doesn't seem to work properly, doesn't acknowledge cuboid nodes in tutorials 4i and 5
	5.a [x] Check to see if old PopulateTree() function works
6. [x] Change WhichZones function, should test against outer walls as well for when moving back up the tree.
	6.a [x] Maybe this could be a coarse initial check.
	(ended up creating a new function that checks if a node is in the surrounding parent octree)
7. [x] Change GenColPairs to make a pair for nodes spanning several octants and children of said octants.
8. [ ] Make the edges of the master octree (root) a boundary (as nodes that go outside said tree causes errors)
