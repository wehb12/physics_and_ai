TO DO LIST

PHYSICS
1. [ ] Change broadphase box dimensions to adjust with the scene, instead of being arbitrarily set
2. [x] Make narrowphase avoid duplicate collision checks on two objects spanning two octants
	2.a [x] Change octree so that a node stradling a boundary is in the parent node's list
		2.a.i [x] Make sure each node is only stored once now, not in multiple lists
3. [ ] Put Octree functionality into its own class
	3.a [ ] Still do this and make Octree a friend of PhysicsEngine
4. [x] Change octree when a node moves zone
	4.a [x] Fix this, the octree breaks when a node moves - possibly not terminating the tree correctly
5. [x] Octree doesn't seem to work properly, doesn't acknowledge cuboid nodes in tutorials 4i and 5
	5.a [x] Check to see if old PopulateTree() function works
6. [x] Change WhichZones function, should test against outer walls as well for when moving back up the tree
	6.a [x] Maybe this could be a coarse initial check
	(ended up creating a new function that checks if a node is in the surrounding parent octree)
7. [x] Change GenColPairs to make a pair for nodes spanning several octants and children of said octants
8. [ ] Make the edges of the master octree (root) a boundary (as nodes that go outside said tree causes errors)
	8.a [x] As an intermediate measure - make the InOctree function return true if the tree is the root
9. [ ] Make the RemovePhysicsNode function update the tree if it removes the final node in a branch
10. [x] Octrees still do not update properly - fix this
11. [x] Only change a PhysicsNode's octree when the velocity is below a certain small value
	11.a [x] This could mean nodes can drift very slowly between trees - maybe integrate over small timestep and chnage when it has moved a small distance proportional to octree size

GPU ACCELERATION
12. [ ] Make the kernel function populate everything necessary to make a manifold of one point (for a sphere-sphere collision)
